{"question": "John can read a book 60% faster than his brother.  If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, how long would it take John to read 3 books?", "answer": "Reading 60% faster means John's brother takes 1+.6=1.6 times as long as John to read\nSo John reads a book in 8/1.6=<<8/1.6=5>>5 hours\nSo it would take John 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 hours to read 3 books\n#### 15", "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant. Please answer the question. \n\n QUESTION:John can read a book 60% faster than his brother.  If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, how long would it take John to read 3 books? \n\n ANSWER: ", "samples": [" John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books. ", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nJohn can read a book 60% faster than his brother, which means that he reads the book at a rate of 60% of his brother's rate. If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, then John takes 8 hours x 0.6 = 4.8 hours to read the same book. To find out how long it would take John to read 3 books, we multiply the time it takes him to read one book by 3.", " John can read 3 books in 5 hours. ", " John would be able to read 3 books in 5 hours. ", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books. \n\nEXPLANATION:\nJohn can read a book 60% faster than his brother, which means that for every hour his brother takes to read a book, John can read it in 60% of that time, or 0.6 \\* 8 = 4.8 hours. \nTherefore, if John's brother takes 8 hours to read a book, John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books. ", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books. ", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books. \n\nEXPLANATION: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to set up a ratio that will help us calculate the time it takes John to read the books. We know that John can read a book 60% faster than his brother, so if his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, John will take 8 hours x 60% = 4.8 hours to read the same book. Therefore, to read 3 books, John will take 3 x 4.8 = 14.4 hours.", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books.\n\n\n", " John can read a book 60% faster than his brother, which means he can read a book in x hours, where x = 8 / 0.6 = 13.33 hours.\nSo, it would take John 13.33 hours to read 1 book, and he would need 3 x 13.33 = 39.99 hours to read 3 books.", " John would be able to read 3 books in 5 hours.

", " John would be able to read 3 books in 5 hours.\n\nEXPLANATION: John can read a book 60% faster than his brother. This means that if his brother reads a book in 8 hours, John would be able to read the same book in 8/60 = 5 hours.", " John can read 3 books in 5 hours.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nJohn can read a book 60% faster than his brother, which means that for every hour his brother takes to read a book, John can read the same book 60% faster, which is 60/0.6 = 100% faster.\nSo, if his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, John can read the same book in 8/1.6 = 5 hours.\nTherefore, John can read 3 books in 5 hours.", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nJohn can read a book 60% faster than his brother, which means that for every hour his brother takes to read a book, John can read 60% of that book in the same amount of time. So if his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, John can read 8 x 60% = 4.8 hours to read the same book.\nTherefore, if John wants to read 3 books, it will take him 3 x 4.8 = 14.4 hours to read all 3 books.", " John would take 4 hours to read 3 books. ", " John would take 4.8 hours to read 3 books.\n\n EXPLANATION:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how long it would take John to read one book. Since his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, John can read a book 60% faster than his brother. So, John would take 8 hours / 0.6 = 13.3 hours to read a book.\nNow, to find out how long it would take John to read 3 books, we can multiply the time it takes him to read one book by 3: 13.3 hours x 3 = 40.9 hours.\nSo, John would take 40.9 hours to read 3 books.", " John would be able to read 3 books in 5 hours.

We know that John can read a book 60% faster than his brother, so if his brother takes x hours to read a book, John will take x/60 hours to read the same book.\nWe are given that John's brother takes 8 hours to read a book, so we can set up the ratio as follows:\nJohn's brother takes 8 hours to read a book\nJohn takes x hours to read the same book\nx/60 = 8\nx = 48\nSo, John will take 48 hours to read 3 books.\n\nRATIO: 60/1 = 60\n\n\n"}
